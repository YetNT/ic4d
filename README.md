# Quick Example

[Here's the example bot](https://github.com/YetNT/ic4d-example-bot) if you don't like reading

```js
require("dotenv").config();
const { Client, IntentsBitField } = require("discord.js");
const path = require("path");

const { CommandHandler, ReadyHandler } = require("ic4d");

const commandsPath = "commands";
const readerOptions = {
    devs: ["671549251024584725"],
    testGuildId: "808701451399725116",
};

const client = new Client({
    intents: [
        IntentsBitField.Flags.Guilds,
        IntentsBitField.Flags.GuildMessages,
    ],
});

const handler = new CommandHandler(
    client,
    path.join(__dirname, "commands"),
    readerOptions
);
const ready = new ReadyHandler(
    client,
    async (client) => {
        console.log(`${client.user.tag} is ready!`);
    },
    async () => {
        await handler.registerCommands();
    }
);

(async () => {
    await handler.handleCommands();
    ready.execute();

client.login(process.env.TOKEN);
```

# ReadyHandler

Ready handler is a handler that runs a set of functions when the bot starts.

## Constructor

-   `client`: Discord.js Client Instance
-   `...functions`: Functions to run when the `execute()` method is called, and the ready event has been emitted. Functions may take one parameter (client) or none.

```js
const { ReadyHandler } = require("ic4d");

const ready = new ReadyHandler(
    client,
    (client) => {
        console.log(`${client.user.tag} is ready!`);
    },
    () => {
        console.log("Lol another function");
    }
);
```

## Methods

### `execute()`

Start listening for the bot's ready event and execute functions once the event is called.

```js
const ready = new ReadyHandler(client, ...)

ready.execute()
```

# CommandHandler

Command Handler, which handles slash command creation, deletion, editing and running of slash commands

```

## Methods

### `registerCommands()`

**(asynchronous function)**

-   `logAll`**: boolean**
-   -   **(optional)** Log command even if no change was performed.
-   `serverId`**: string**
-   -   **(optional)** Register all commands in a specific server. if not provided it will be application wide

async () => {
    await handler.registerCommands();
};
```

### `handleCommands()`

**(asynchronous function)**

-   `...middleWare`**: ( ( commandObject: Object, interaction?: [ChatInputCommandInteraction](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/main/ChatInputCommandInteraction:Class) ) => number | Promise<number> )[]**
-   -   Functions to run before a command is run.

const blacklisted = ["302983482377931"];
const blacklist = (commandObject, interaction) => {
    if (commandObject.blacklist && blacklisted.includes(interaction.user.id)) {
        interaction.reply({
            content: this.readerOptions.onlyDev,
            ephemeral: true,
        });
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
};

await handler.handleCommands(blacklist);
```

#### Middleware Parameters and use

Middleware is to define your own custom functions you want to run when a command is run by anyone. This can be a function to check for cooldown or function to add XP to a user.

Middleware that the package already contains is :

-   Check to see if developer command
-   Check to see if bot has sufficient permissions
-   Check to see if user has sufficient permissions

The Middleware **must** take in these parameters

-   `commandObject`: This is the commandObject that every command contains, this can check for the commands name, description, options, choices or a custom property you wish
-   `interaction`**(optional)**: If the middleware function requires you to take in interaction for some reason, here you go ðŸ˜ƒ

And should always return 1 or another number. If it returns 1 it counts as a fail so the function won't proceed. Another number returned is okay seen as a pass and the function continues.
(If you don't understand, if a normal user tries to run a dev command, it will return 1, which means it wont run and their met with a fail message)

##### Example

Here i define a command with the custom property `canBeServerDisabled`

```js
const {SlashCommandManager} = require("ic4d");
const {SlashCommandBuilder} = require("discord.js");

const rob = new SlashCommandManager({
    data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
        .setName("rob")
        .setDescription("Rob users")
    execute: (interaction, client) => {
        interaction.reply("bang bang!");
    },
});

rob.canBeServerDisabled = true;

module.exports = rob
```

And in my middleware function i check if the command has been server disabled, if the property is enabled.

```js
const isServerDisabled = (name) => {
    // check to see if the function has been disabled by the server, if so return true, otherwise false.
};

const middleWare = (commandObject, interaction) => {
    // you can name the parameters whatever you want, ass long as you remember which one is which.
    if (
        commandObject.canBeServerDisabled &&
        isServerDisabled(commandObject.name)
    ) {
        interaction.reply({
            content: "This command is server disabled",
            ephemeral: true,
        });
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
};

handler.handleCommands(middleWare); // pass the function alone without brackets or its parameters, i'll do that magic
```

### `emitErrors()`

Set whether the ready handler should throw or emit errors. Defaults to false.

```js
const handler = new CommandHandler(client, path.join(__dirname, "commands"));
handler.emitErrors(true);

// Listen for the error
handler.on("error", (msg) => {
    // do something with the error message
});
```

# RunFlags

An interface representing the configuration flags used for running commands in the bot.

This configuration is specifically used to control various runtime aspects of command execution.

## Properties

### **_testGuildId: string_**

```
Default value: undefined
```

The ID of the test guild for command testing purposes. If provided, commands will be deployed only to this guild.

### **_devs: string[]_**

```
Default value: []
```

An array of Discord user IDs (snowflakes) that have developer privileges.

Commands or functionalities restricted to developers will be accessible to users with IDs in this array.

### **_onlyDev: string_**

```
Default value: "Only developers are allowed to run this command."
```

The message shown when a command restricted to developers is executed by a non-developer.

### **_userNoPerms: string_**

```
Default value: "Not enough permissions."
```

The message displayed when a user lacks the necessary permissions to execute a command.

### **_botNoPerms: string_**

```
Default value: "I don't have enough permissions."
```

The message displayed when the bot lacks the necessary permissions to execute a command.

## Exmaple Use

```ts
const obj: RunFlags = {
    testGuildId: "808701451399725116",
    devs: ["671549251024584725"],

    onlyDev: "Text to display when a user runs a developer command.",
    userNoPerms: "Text to display when the user has insufficient permissions",
    botNoPerms: "Text to display when the bot has insufficient permissions",
};
```

# HandlerFlags

An interface that represents anything you can do with the commands when they are run, BUT before YOUR code executes.

## Properties

### **_debugger: boolean_**

```
Default value: false
```

Enable debugger mode. Prints(almost) everything that happens behind the scenes of course not with the API itself.

### **_disableLogs: boolean_**

```
Default value: false
```

Disabling Logging of the Command Loader. Not advisable but hey it's your bot.

### **_esImports: boolean_**

```brainfuck
- NOT SURE IF IT WORKS, STILL NEED TO TEST.
```

```
Default value: false
```

Enable this if you're using typescript, Allows for es imports.

### **_esImportsDisableNoExportFound: boolean_**

```brainfuck
- NOT SURE IF IT WORKS, STILL NEED TO TEST.
```

```
Default value: false
```

If you're using esImports, and you leave this at it's default, then if a file ion the commands folder does not export a SlashCommandManager class as one of the exports, an error will be thrown.

### **_production: boolean_**

```
Default value: false
```

Whether or not this is the production version of the bot. If set to true, commands labelled `isDev` will NOT be loaded. (Use the `setDev()` method in [SlashCommandManager](#slashcommandmanager))

### **_refreshApplicationCommands?: boolean_**

```
Default value: false
```

Clears ALL application commands on startup. (Slash commands, User commands, and Message commands.)

## Example Use

```ts
const obj: LoaderOptions = {
    debugger: true,
    production: true,
    disableLogs: true,
    esImports: false, // I like my life simple.
};
```

# LoaderOptions

Interface that represents default string values for the loader to log to the console when it encounters a command/context menu.

Make sure you keep `NAME` in the string or else you will not know what happened to which command.
If there is no log in the console for a specific command, then it has been loaded, there are no edits and it has not been deleted.

## Properties

Note:

> These have multiple default values, as context menus and commands are different.

### **_loaded: string_**

What to show for context menus/commands that load in

### **_edited: string_**

What to show for context menus/commands that gets edited.

### **_deleted: string_**

What to show for context menus/commands that gets deleted.

### **_skipped: string_**

What to show for context menus/commands that gets skipped. (Deleted and still marked as deleted.)

### **_loadedNoChanges: string_**

What to show for context menus/commands that gets loaded, but has no changes

## Example Use

```ts
const obj: LoaderOptions = {
    loadedNoChanges: "NAME was loaded. No changes were made to NAME.",
    loaded: "NAME has been registered successfully.",
    edited: "NAME has been edited.",
    deleted: "NAME has been deleted.",
    skipped: "NAME was skipped. (Command deleted or set to delete.)",
};
```

# InteractionTypeStrings

Type alias for the strings `"selectMenu"`, `"modal"` and `"button"`

Yes this did not need documenting, but here it is.

# InteractionTypeStringsMap

Here's the exact definition because I genuinely don't know how to explain this.

```ts
export type InteractionTypeStringsMap<U extends string> = U extends "modal"
    ? ModalSubmitInteraction
    : U extends "selectMenu"
    ? AnySelectMenuInteraction
    : U extends "button"
    ? ButtonInteraction
    : never;
```

# Common Problems

1.  _Files in the `commands` directory trying to be read as slash commmands by the `CommandHandler` class._

    -   Example: This function is in the `commands` direcotory as it is used by multiple commands, but is not a commands itself.

    ```js
    const function a(userBalance) {
        return userBalance > 0 ? true : false;
    }

    module.exports = a;
    ```

    -   The Command Reader will try to read it but error as it is not a command it can read, to avoid this, make sure you export the `isCommand` (Set to false) property with the function.

    ```js
    const function a(userBalance) {
        return userBalance > 0 ? true : false;
    }

    module.exports = {a, isCommand = false};
    ```

    -   Usually, the reader should skip over anything it can read, but if needed, this will immediately make it skip.

# Credits

Huge credit to [underctrl](https://github.com/notunderctrl), Code would've not been possible if i did not watch his helpful discord.js tutorials! I had to give him credit because this package is based off moving all those files fromm his tutorial into one package.

He probably has a way better package, so go check his out!
