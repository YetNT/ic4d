# Quick Example

[Here's the example bot](https://github.com/YetNT/ic4d-example-bot) if you don't like reading

this is what you're index.js should look something like.

```js
require("dotenv").config();
const { Client, IntentsBitField } = require("discord.js");
const path = require("path");

const { CommandHandler, ReadyHandler } = require("ic4d");

const commandsPath = "commands";
const runFlags = {
    devs: ["671549251024584725"],
    testGuildId: "808701451399725116",
};

const client = new Client({
    intents: [
        IntentsBitField.Flags.Guilds,
        IntentsBitField.Flags.GuildMessages,
    ],
});

const handler = new CommandHandler(
    client,
    path.join(__dirname, commandsPath),
    runFlags
);
const ready = new ReadyHandler(
    client,
    async (client) => {
        console.log(`${client.user.tag} is ready!`);
    },
    async () => {
        await handler.registerCommands();
    }
);

(async () => {
    ready.execute();
    await handler.handleCommands();
})();

client.login(process.env.TOKEN);
```

And in any file in any folder under your specified `commands` directory

```js
const { EmbedBuilder, SlashCommandBuilder } = require("discord.js");

# ReadyHandler

Ready handler is a handler that runs a set of functions when the bot starts.

## Constructor

-   `client`**: [Client](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/main/Client:Class)**
    -   Discord.js Client Instance
-   `...functions`**: ((client?: [Client](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/main/Client:Class)) => Promise\<void> | void )[] = []**
    -   Functions to run when the `execute()` method is called, and the ready event has been emitted. Functions may take one parameter (client) or none.

```js
const { ReadyHandler } = require("ic4d");

const ready = new ReadyHandler(
    client,
    (client) => {
        console.log(`${client.user.tag} is ready!`);
    },
    () => {
        console.log("Lol another function");
    }
);
```

## Methods

### `execute()`

Start listening for the bot's ready event and execute functions once the event is called.

```js
const ready = new ReadyHandler(client, ...)

ready.execute()
```

```

### `handleCommands()`

**(asynchronous function)**

-   `middleWare`**: ( ( commandObject: Object, interaction?: [ChatInputCommandInteraction](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/main/ChatInputCommandInteraction:Class) ) => number | Promise<number> )[]**
    -   Functions to run before a command is run.

const blacklisted = ["302983482377931"];
const blacklist = (commandObject, interaction) => {
    if (commandObject.blacklist && blacklisted.includes(interaction.user.id)) {
        interaction.reply({
            content: this.readerOptions.onlyDev,
            ephemeral: true,
        });
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
};

const addXp = (commandObject, interaction) => {
    if (commandObject.category != "Economy") return;
    // Xp stuff
};

await handler.handleCommands([blacklist], [addXp]);
```

#### Middleware Parameters and use

> [!NOTE]  
> This is ONLY for `middleWare` and does NOT apply to `postWare` functions.

Middleware is to define your own custom functions you want to run when a command is run by anyone. This can be a function to check for cooldown or function to add XP to a user.

Middleware that the package already contains is :

-   Check to see if developer command
-   Check to see if bot has sufficient permissions
-   Check to see if user has sufficient permissions

The Middleware **must** take in these parameters

-   `commandObject`: This is the commandObject that every command contains, this can check for the commands name, description, options, choices or a custom property you wish
-   `interaction`**(optional)**: If the middleware function requires you to take in interaction for some reason, here you go ðŸ˜ƒ

And should always return 1 or another number. If it returns 1 it counts as a fail so the function won't proceed. Another number returned is okay seen as a pass and the function continues.
(If you don't understand, if a normal user tries to run a dev command, it will return 1, which means it wont run and their met with a fail message)

##### Example

Here i define a command with the custom property `canBeServerDisabled`

```js
const {SlashCommandManager} = require("ic4d");
const {SlashCommandBuilder} = require("discord.js");

const rob = new SlashCommandManager({
    data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
        .setName("rob")
        .setDescription("Rob users")
    execute: (interaction, client) => {
        interaction.reply("bang bang!");
    },
});

rob.canBeServerDisabled = true;

module.exports = rob
```

And in my middleware function i check if the command has been server disabled, if the property is enabled.

```js
const isServerDisabled = (name) => {
    // check to see if the function has been disabled by the server, if so return true, otherwise false.
};

const middleWare = (commandObject, interaction) => {
    // you can name the parameters whatever you want, ass long as you remember which one is which.
    if (
        commandObject.canBeServerDisabled &&
        isServerDisabled(commandObject.name)
    ) {
        interaction.reply({
            content: "This command is server disabled",
            ephemeral: true,
        });
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
};

handler.handleCommands([middleWare]); // pass the function alone without brackets or its parameters, i'll do that magic
```

Default value: false
```

Clears ALL application commands on startup. (Slash commands, User commands, and Message commands.)

### **_logToFile: string | false_**

```
Default value: false
```

When debugger mode is enabled, Either log to console or a file.

    debugger: true,
    production: true,
    disableLogs: true,
};
```

# InteractionHandlerFlags

An interface that represents anything you can do with the interactions when they are run, BUT before YOUR code executes.

## Properties

### **_debugger: boolean_**

```
Default value: false
```

Enable Debugger mode. Prints (almost) everything that happens behind the scenes of course not with the API itself.

### **_disableLogs: boolean_**

```
Default value: false
```

Disabling Logging of the Context Menu Loader. Not advised but hey it's your bot. Default is false.

### **_refreshContextMenus: boolean_**

```
Default value: false
```

Clears Context Menus

### **_logToFile: string | false_**

```
Default value: false
```

When debugger mode is enabled, Either log to console or a file.

# LoaderOptions

Interface that represents default string values for the loader to log to the console when it encounters a command/context menu.

Make sure you keep `NAME` in the string or else you will not know what happened to which command.
If there is no log in the console for a specific command, then it has been loaded, there are no edits and it has not been deleted.

## Properties

Note:

> These have multiple default values, as context menus and commands are different.

### **_loaded: string_**

What to show for context menus/commands that load in

### **_edited: string_**

What to show for context menus/commands that gets edited.

### **_deleted: string_**

What to show for context menus/commands that gets deleted.

### **_skipped: string_**

What to show for context menus/commands that gets skipped. (Deleted and still marked as deleted.)

### **_loadedNoChanges: string_**

What to show for context menus/commands that gets loaded, but has no changes

## Example Use

```ts
const obj: LoaderOptions = {
    loadedNoChanges: "NAME was loaded. No changes were made to NAME.",
    loaded: "NAME has been registered successfully.",
    edited: "NAME has been edited.",
    deleted: "NAME has been deleted.",
    skipped: "NAME was skipped. (Command deleted or set to delete.)",
};
```

# InteractionTypeStrings

Type alias for the strings `"selectMenu"`, `"modal"` and `"button"`

Yes this did not need documenting, but here it is.

# InteractionTypeStringsMap

Here's the exact definition because I genuinely don't know how to explain this.

```ts
export type InteractionTypeStringsMap<U extends string> = U extends "modal"
    ? ModalSubmitInteraction
    : U extends "selectMenu"
    ? AnySelectMenuInteraction
    : U extends "button"
    ? ButtonInteraction
    : never;
```

# Common Problems

1.  _Files in the `commands` directory trying to be read as slash commmands by the `CommandHandler` class._

    -   Example: This function is in the `commands` direcotory as it is used by multiple commands, but is not a commands itself.

    ```js
    const function a(userBalance) {
        return userBalance > 0 ? true : false;
    }

    module.exports = a;
    ```

    -   The Command Reader will try to read it but error as it is not a command it can read, to avoid this, make sure you export the `isCommand` (Set to false) property with the function.

    ```js
    const function a(userBalance) {
        return userBalance > 0 ? true : false;
    }

    module.exports = {a, isCommand = false};
    ```

    -   Usually, the reader should skip over anything it can read, but if needed, this will immediately make it skip.

# Credits

Huge credit to [underctrl](https://github.com/notunderctrl), Code would've not been possible if i did not watch his helpful discord.js tutorials! I had to give him credit because this package is based off moving all those files fromm his tutorial into one package.

He probably has a way better package, so go check his out!
